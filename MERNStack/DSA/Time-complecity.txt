Qwhat is algorithm complecity?
Q time complexity 
Ans:the time complexity is mainly calculated by country the number
of the steps to finish the execution

Qwhat is the space?

Ans:::space complecity is the amount of space required to solve a proble
.:space complexity = auxiliary space +input size;

::Big 0 notation : use to denote complecity(both)

///Time complecity 

how manay line works ?

Ans:: // Date =[] ::data -- line 1

//elemnet=80 \\ delemnet  -- line 1
// define a lopp  -- line 4
//mach  element  -- line  1 
// if else =mach -- line 1
//if not match  -- line 1
//not resdult found  -- line 1 



10 is time complexity


//Space complexity /// 1 MB 


///Big 0 notation is 


Q What is Asymptotic analysis and notation?

Ans:What is asymptotic analysis? || f(n) = 5n2 + 6n +12

..how to calculate time complexity

..Asymptotic Notations



5n2+6w+12 //
5(100)2 + 6(100)+12

5(1000)+600+12

50000+600+12 == 50000
