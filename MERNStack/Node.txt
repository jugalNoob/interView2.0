Q what is Node Architecture?

Ans::  Client  ------------->Request ------> node mean server

Sure! Here are some commonly asked Node.js interview questions:

1::What is Node.js?
Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable and high-performance applications. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript 
engine and provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.


...Node.js is a Runtime Env for Javascript

..You can run js outside of the browers

..Javascript can talk to native machine because of C++

.. You can create webservers in javscript  language
const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});
const port = 3000;
server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}/`);
});


..Client side vs server side

::::Clent Side
...Runs in the User's Browser: Client-side code, typically written in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is executed in the user's web browser.

..User Interface

..Fast Response: Client-side processing provides faster responses t

..Examples: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.


::Servee Side

...Runs on the Server: Server-side code is executed on a remote server, not in the user's browser.
...usiness Logic: It's responsible for processing data, performing business logic, and interacting with databases
...Secure: Server-side code can perform sensitive operations and is generally more secure as it's not visible or accessible to users.
...Slower Response: Server-side processing can introduce latency because it often requires network requests from the client to the server and back.

Data Types:
Primitive Types: Include numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, and symbols (added in ES6).


Functions:
Regular Functions: Standard functions defined with the function keyword.
Arrow Functions: Introduced in ES6, providing a concise syntax and capturing the this value from the surrounding context.

Async Programming:

Callbacks: Used traditionally for handling asynchronous operations.
Promises: Introduced in ES6, providing a more structured way to deal with asynchronous code.
Async/Await: ES8 introduced this syntax for handling promises in a more synchronous manner.

Modules:

ES6 Modules: Allow exporting and importing functionalities among JavaScript files using import and export statements.
CommonJS Modules: Supported by Node.js using require() and module.exports


|||||||||||||||||||||Node.js deifferent Types ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Modules:

Core Modules: Built-in modules like http, fs (file system), os (operating system), etc., providing essential functionalities.
Third-Party Modules: External modules installed via npm to extend Node.js capabilities. Examples include Express.js for web application frameworks, Axios for HTTP requests, etc.


Package Management:
npm (Node Package Manager): The default package manager for Node.js, enabling easy installation and management of dependencies for Node.js projects.


Frameworks:
Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework widely used for building APIs and web applications.


Event-driven Architecture:
Event Emitters: Node.js utilizes an event-driven architecture, allowing certain objects (like HTTP servers) to emit events that trigger listener functions to react accordingly.


Streams:
Readable/Writable Streams: Node.js provides a powerful way to handle data streams, enabling efficient processing of large files or network data.







Q what is Module.js?

Ans:In Node.js, modules are a fundamental part of the CommonJS module system,
which allows you to organize your JavaScript code into reusable 
and encapsulated units. Node.js uses the require function to load and
use modules, and you can create your own modules to structure your application.

Q what is NPM?

Ans:



27. What is meant by an event-loop in Node JS?

The event-loop manages the async content using a listener and queue. The main thread sends the async 
function to a different thread whenever it requires to be executed. Alongside, v8 is allowed to execute
 the main code. The event loop has different stages including pending callbacks, timers, check, poll, close callbacks,
 etc. with different FIFO queues.




Q how node.js work?

Ans:

Q Differentiate between Node JS and Express JS.
Node JS is an open-source platform on which the JavaScript code is executed outside of a browser. It
 is used by several companies, including Uber, Walmart, Netflix, etc. It is a platform acting as a web 
server and not a programming language or framework. On the other hand,
 Express JS is a framework built on Node JS.



Q  Differentiate between worker threads and clusters in Node JS.
Cluster:Each CPU has one process with an IPC to communicate.
 --> Clusters help when multiple servers are required to accept HTTP requests through
 a single port.
--->?The processes have separate memory because of being spanned in different CPUs 
leading to memory issues.


Worker Threads:

Only a single process is there with multiple threads.
Each Node contains one Node having most APIs accessible.
The memory is shared with other threads.We can use this for CPU-intensive tasks.

Q what is serverLess?

Ans::Serverless Architectures: Leveraging services like AWS
Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions
with Node.js allows developers to build scalable, 
event-driven systems without managing servers.

Function Optimization::: Crafting functions to be
lightweight and efficient for faster execution in serverless environments.


Q what is WebSockets ?

Ans:WebSockets: Real-time communication is crucial,


Q what is Streaming ?
Ans:



Q WebSockets:

Socket.io: Building real-time applications with 
Socket.io for bidirectional communication between
clients and servers.

Scaling WebSockets: Strategies for scaling 
WebSocket connections across multiple servers or
using load balancers effectively.


Q what is Buffer in Node.js?
Ans:
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world', 'utf8');

console.log(buf.toString('hex'));

console.log(buf.toString('base64'));
// Prints: aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=


// Creating a Buffer from a string ::::::::::::
const bufferFromString = Buffer.from('Hello, Buffer!', 'utf-8');
console.log(bufferFromString);

// Creating a Buffer with a specific size ::::::::::::::::
const bufferSize = 10;
const emptyBuffer = Buffer.alloc(bufferSize);
console.log(emptyBuffer);


Manipulating Buffers: :::::::::::::::

// Slicing a Buffer
const originalBuffer = Buffer.from('Sample Buffer');
const slicedBuffer = originalBuffer.slice(7);
console.log(slicedBuffer.toString()); // Output: Buffer

// Writing to a Buffer
const bufferToWrite = Buffer.alloc(10);
bufferToWrite.write('Writing', 'utf-8');
console.log(bufferToWrite.toString()); // Output: Writing

// Copying between Buffers
const sourceBuffer = Buffer.from('Copy from this');
const targetBuffer = Buffer.alloc(20);
sourceBuffer.copy(targetBuffer);
console.log(targetBuffer.toString()); // Output: Copy from this




Buffer and Streams: ::::::---------------------->

const fs = require('fs');

// Reading data from a file using Buffers and Streams
const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('file.txt');
let data = '';
readableStream.on('data', chunk => {
  data += chunk;
});
readableStream.on('end', () => {
  console.log(data); // Output: Contents of file.txt
});



// Parsing binary data   ---------------> ::::::::::::::::
const binaryData = Buffer.from('f09f9880', 'hex'); // UTF-8 encoded bytes for a Unicode character
console.log(binaryData.toString('utf-8')); // Output: ðŸ˜€





Security Considerations: :::::::: -------------->

// Creating a safe Buffer from a string
const safeBuffer = Buffer.from('Safe Buffer', 'utf-8');
console.log(safeBuffer);

// Creating a potentially unsafe Buffer
const unsafeBuffer = Buffer.allocUnsafe(10);
unsafeBuffer.fill(0); // Fill the buffer with zeros
console.log(unsafeBuffer);

// Handling potential security issues with Buffer allocation
const safeBuffer2 = Buffer.alloc(10);
safeBuffer2.fill(0);
console.log(safeBuffer2);


Typed Arrays vs. Buffers: -------------->

// Using Typed Arrays (Uint8Array) instead of Buffers for certain operations
const uint8Array = new Uint8Array(5);
uint8Array[0] = 5;
console.log(uint8Array);
