Q what is express.js ?

Ans:


Qwhat is header in express.js?
In Express.js, the "header" refers to the part of the HTTP response that contains
 metadata about the response. It consists of key-value pairs that provide additional
information about the response,  such as the content type, caching directives, cookies, and more.

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html'); // Set the Content-Type header
  res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-store'); // Set the Cache-Control header

  res.send('<h1>Hello, World!</h1>'); // Send the response body
});



Q what node.js Mthods ??

1::GET: The GET method is used to retrieve data from a server.
2::POST: The POST method is used to submit data to the server for processing. 
3::PUT: The PUT method is used to update an existing resource on the server. It sends the updated
4::DELETE: The DELETE method is used to delete a specified resource on the server. It requests the server to remove the specified resource.
5::PATCH: The PATCH method is used to partially update an existing resource on the server
6::HEAD: The HEAD method is similar to the GET method but retrieves only the headers of the response, 



Explain the difference between req.params and req.query in Express.js.??

Ans::

--->It contains route parameters extracted from the URL path.
--->Used for accessing route parameters defined in the route path.
--->Route parameters are specified in the route path and are part of the URL itself.
--->For example, in the route /users/:id, :id is a route parameter that can be accessed using req.params.id.
--->app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  // Use userId in further processing
  res.send(`User ID: ${userId}`);
});


-->It contains the query parameters from the URL.
-->Used for accessing query parameters present in the URL after the ? symbol.
-->Query parameters are typically used for filtering, sorting, or providing additional data in a request.
-->Accessed using req.query.parameterName.

// For URL: /search?term=node&category=tech
app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
  const searchTerm = req.query.term;
  const category = req.query.category;
  // Use searchTerm and category in further processing
  res.send(`Search Term: ${searchTerm}, Category: ${category}`);
});



0:16:31 What is Middleware in Express.js?
::Logging: Middleware can log information about the incoming requests,
 such as the request method, URL, request headers, and more.

Q what is middleware types?

Ans: 

Application-Level Middleware: app.use(): It's used to mount middleware functions at a specified path
Global Error Handling:

Global Error Handling: Using app.use() to define error-handling middleware at the application
 level, ensuring it catches errors from all routes.

Router-Level Middleware::app.use()  ---------->

Built-in Middleware: -------->
Express.js provides several built-in middleware functions:
express.json(): Parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.
express.urlencoded(): Parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads.
express.static(): Serves static files and assets in a director


Error-Handling Middleware: ------->
Middleware functions with four parameters (err, req, res, next) 


Third-Party Middleware: --------------->
body-parser: Parses incoming request bodies in a middleware before handlers.
helmet: Helps secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.


const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Custom middleware function
const logMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Received a ${req.method} request at ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Call next to move to the next middleware or route handler
};

// Using middleware globally
app.use(logMiddleware);

// Route handling - a simple example
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, this is the home page!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});


Qwhat is JWT?

1::JWT stands for JSON Web Token. In the context of
 Express.js, JWT is a popular method for authentication and 
authorization. It allows you to securely transmit
 information between parties as a JSON object.


 Here's how JWT works in Express.js: 

 2:::Authentication 

 3:::Token Transmission: The server sends the JWT back to
the client as a response. The client typically stores the JWT in local storage, session storage,
or a cookie.


5::Token Verification::




Qwhat is cookies parse?
In Express.js, cookie parsing refers to the process of extracting
 and handling cookies sent by the client in the HTTP request.
 Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on the
 client-side and sent along with subsequent requests to the server

 const express = require('express');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

const app = express();

app.use(cookieParser());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const cookies = req.cookies;

  console.log(cookies); // Access the parsed cookies
});



Q what is different jwt and cookies?




0:02:32 What are Express.js Features?
Routing: Express.js allows you to define routes for different HTTP methods 
and URLs. You can handle requests for specific routes by defining corresponding 
route handlers. This makes it easy to create a structured API or handle different pages of a web application.


Middleware: Express.js has built-in support for middleware functions. Middleware 
functions can be used to modify the request and response objects, perform
 tasks like authentication, logging, data parsing, error handling, 


 Error Handling: Express.js makes it easy to handle errors in your application. 
 You can define custom error-handling middleware to catch and process errors that occur during 

Flexibility: JWTs provide flexibility in terms of the data payload they can contain.
 Custom claims can be added to the payload, providing additional information about the user or application-specific
  data. Cookies, on the other hand, are limited to
 storing simple key-value pairs.

 
Robust Request and Response Handling: Express.js provides a simple and intuitive API 
for handling HTTP requests and responses. You can easily 
access request parameters, headers, cookies, and query strings. Similarly, 


Q what  is Error handling in javscript?


Error handling in Express.js is a crucial aspect of 
building robust and reliable web applications. Here
 are some key topics and best practices related 
to error handling in Express:


1::Error Handling Middleware: Implementing error-handling middleware using functions with four parameters (err, req, res, next).


2::Global Error Handling: Using app.use() to define error-handling middleware at the application level, 

3::Next Function with Errors: Using next(err)


4::Next Function with Errors: Using next(err)

5::Custom Error Handling:

6::HTTP Status Codes: Using appropriate HTTP status codes in error responses (e.g., 404 for not found, 500 for server errors



Q what status error ?

Ans::200 OK: The request was successful.

201 Created:--> The request has been fulfilled, resulting 
in the creation of a new resource.

400 Bad Request:--> The server cannot process the 
request due to a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax).
401 Unauthorized: The request requires authentication or the user does not have proper authorization.
404 Not Found: The server cannot find the requested resource.
500 Internal Server Error: A generic server error occurred while processing the request.

Q what is params in express:

Ans::// Define a route with URL parameters
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  // Retrieve user data based on the provided ID
  res.send(`User ID: ${userId}`);
});

Q :53 How to allow CORS in Express.js?
To allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in an
Express.js application, you can use the cors middleware package. 
CORS is a mechanism that allows web browsers to make cross-origin requests, 
enabling resources on one domain to be accessed by a web page on a 
different domain. Here's how you can enable CORS in Express.js:
